# Stock Market Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

The provided code is a Python script that demonstrates time series forecasting using a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. It includes the following key components and steps:

## 1. Importing Libraries:
The script starts by importing necessary Python libraries:

- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `pandas` for handling data.
- `tensorflow` for machine learning and deep learning.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.
- `pandas_datareader` for retrieving financial data.

## 2. Uploading Trained Model from Google Drive:
This section mounts Google Drive to the Colab environment and loads a pre-trained LSTM model from a specific path in Google Drive. The purpose of this is to use a previously trained model for forecasting.

## 3. Model Forecast and Plot Series Functions:
Two functions are defined here:

- `model_forecast(model, series, window_size)`: This function takes a trained model, a time series dataset, and a window size as input. It uses the model to predict future values for the time series data based on the given window size. It uses TensorFlow's Dataset API to create suitable input data and returns the forecasted values.

- `plot_series(time, series, format, start, end)`: A function for plotting time series data with labels and grid lines.

## 4. Uploading the Dataset:
The script retrieves historical stock price data for Google (GOOGL) using `pandas_datareader`. The data covers the period from February 1, 2020, to July 15, 2020.

## 5. Close Trend:
This section generates a time step sequence for the dataset and plots the closing prices of the stock over time. The closing prices are taken from the DataFrame, and a plot is generated using Matplotlib.

## 6. Preprocessing the Data:
The code preprocesses the closing price data by scaling it using `MinMaxScaler` to bring the values within the range [0, 1].

## 7. Getting the Forecasted Values:
The script calculates forecasted values using the `model_forecast` function. It takes the preprocessed data and window size as input. The forecasted values are reshaped and collected into a list named `results`.

## 8. Increasing the Time for Forecasting:
This part extends the time steps for forecasting by creating a time sequence that includes both the original time steps and additional steps for future predictions. The extended time steps are stored in the `time_prd` variable.

## 9. Plotting the Graph and Comparing:
The script generates a plot to visualize the actual closing values and the forecasted values. It combines the original closing values and the predicted values, with labels, legends, and a title.

## 10. Issues:
The author notes a potential issue where the graph becomes unstable when trying to make more predictions by inputting additional data for forecasting. The reason behind this instability is attributed to the amount of data being fed for forecasting or the need for an altered solution.

In summary, the code demonstrates the process of loading a pre-trained LSTM model, using it to forecast future values of a stock's closing prices, and visualizing the results. It also identifies a limitation related to the amount of data used for forecasting.
