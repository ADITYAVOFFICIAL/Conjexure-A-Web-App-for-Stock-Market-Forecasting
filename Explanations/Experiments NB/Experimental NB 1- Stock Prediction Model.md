# Stock Market Data Analysis and Time Series Forecasting

This Python script provides an end-to-end example of time series forecasting for stock market data using TensorFlow/Keras. It covers various aspects of the project, including data retrieval, exploration, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality, structure, and relevant programming concepts and libraries used:

### 1. Imports and Setup
- The code begins with necessary imports, including NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib, which are common libraries for data manipulation, deep learning, and data visualization.

### 2. Data Retrieval
- The code uses the `pandas_datareader` library to fetch historical stock market data for Alphabet Inc. (Google) from Yahoo Finance. The data covers the period from April 1, 2008, to July 15, 2020.

### 3. Data Exploration
- The code explores the retrieved dataset by providing information about its structure (`.info()`) and basic statistics (`.describe()`).

### 4. Data Plotting
- The code defines a `plot_series` function to visualize the time series data. This function is later used to create line charts of the stock's closing prices.

### 5. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is further processed, and a univariate time series is created by selecting the 'Close' price. The data is normalized using a Min-Max scaler.

### 6. Train-Validation Split
- The data is split into a training set and a validation set.

### 7. Windowed Dataset Preparation
- Functions `windowed_dataset` and `windowed_valid_dataset` are defined to prepare windowed datasets. These functions create input-output pairs for training the model.

### 8. Model Definition
- The model architecture is defined, which consists of Conv1D, LSTM layers, and dense layers. The model's purpose is to forecast future stock prices.

### 9. Model Training
- The model is compiled with a loss function and optimizer. It is then trained on the windowed training dataset. The history of the training is stored for later analysis.

### 10. Model Forecasting
- The model is used to forecast future stock prices, and the results are stored in `rnn_forecast`.

### 11. Evaluation and Plotting
- The forecasted results are evaluated using the mean absolute error. The original and forecasted values are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

### 12. Beyond Forecasting
- The code concludes with a section titled "Beyond Future Forecasting," but it doesn't contain any code or explanations related to that section.

The code's primary goal is to demonstrate time series forecasting using deep learning techniques. It fetches historical stock data, preprocesses it, trains a model, and evaluates the model's performance. It uses various techniques such as windowed datasets, Conv1D, LSTM layers, and Min-Max scaling. The quality of the model's predictions is assessed using the mean absolute error.
