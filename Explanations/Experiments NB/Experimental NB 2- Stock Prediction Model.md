# Stock Market Data Analysis and Forecasting

The provided code is a Python script that uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for time series forecasting on historical stock price data. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the code's functionality, structure, and key concepts:

## 1. Importing Libraries
- The script begins by importing necessary Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data handling, TensorFlow for machine learning, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## 2. Data Retrieval
- The code uses the `pandas_datareader` library to fetch historical stock price data for Alphabet Inc. (Google) from Yahoo Finance. The data is collected from April 15, 2007, to June 1, 2020.

## 3. Data Exploration
- The script provides basic information and statistics about the retrieved dataset using `df_g.info()` and `df_g.describe()`.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
- The stock's closing prices are extracted from the dataset and normalized using the `MinMaxScaler`.

## 5. Windowing and Batching
- The dataset is windowed to create sequences of data suitable for training a time series model. The script uses the `windowed_dataset` function to create windowed and batched datasets for training and validation.

## 6. Model Building
- The script builds a time series forecasting model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of Conv1D layers, LSTM layers, and Dense layers. It uses the Huber loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## 7. Training the Model
- The model is trained on the training dataset using the `fit` method with a specified number of epochs.

## 8. Model Forecasting
- The model is used to make predictions on the validation dataset using the `model_forecast` function.

## 9. Validation and Visualization
- The script visualizes the actual stock prices and the model's predictions on the validation dataset using Matplotlib. The results are displayed in a line chart.

## 10. Future Forecasting
- The code demonstrates how to use the trained model for future forecasting. It fetches additional data from Yahoo Finance for a specific period and predicts future stock prices.

## 11. Visualization of Future Predictions
- The script visualizes the model's predictions for future stock prices for a specified number of days.

In summary, the code collects historical stock price data, preprocesses it, builds and trains a time series forecasting model, validates the model's performance, and provides an example of using the model for future stock price predictions. The code demonstrates a practical application of machine learning for financial time series analysis.
