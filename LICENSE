**Project Name**: Conjexure

**Description**:

Conjexure is a machine learning web app for forecasting stock prices of certain companies into the future. It leverages machine learning techniques, particularly recurrent neural networks (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM), to make stock price predictions based on historical data. The application primarily focuses on predicting stock prices for a user-specified future window of 1 to 5 weeks.

**Getting Started**:

To explore Conjexure, visit our web app at [https://conjexure.herokuapp.com](https://conjexure.herokuapp.com).

**Running on a Local Machine**:

To run Conjexure on your local machine, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Pandas_datareader
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib.pyplot

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit yfinance numpy pandas tensorflow keras scikit-learn matplotlib
